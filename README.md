- 👋 Hi, I’m Brian West, a Computer Engineer. This is where I will be (hopefully) working on projects that will better my skills as an engineer. 
- 👀 I’m interested in developing skills in embedded systems, C/C++, HDLs, and whatever else catches my attention!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about C# and developing GUI applications. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that are related to my interests. 
- 📫 It is best to reach me through my email: bwestrd@gmail.com
